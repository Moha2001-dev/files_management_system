Files Management System (FMS) helps you manage your files in one place offering a straightforward, easy-to-use, and modern UI design.
Originally I developed this project at the request of my father and meant to manage "المعاملات".

## Features:
- Home Screen to view your files
- Add Files with keywords and attachments
- Search Files using keywords
- Modify Files (delete and edit)
- Safe Deletion and Cancling actions
- Save Settings
- Local Database

## What Next For FMS?
I am planning to add 2 more features:
A direct way of adding attachments using an external Scanner.
Tags that can be added to each File and could be customizable means you can create your own tags to categorize files.
FMS was a good project to spend my free time on while I was looking for a job, However, It is not my main focus at the moment.
