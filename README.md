## What Next For FMS?
I am planning to add 2 more features:
- A direct way of adding attachments using an external Scanner.
- Tags that can be added to each File and could be customizable means you can create your own tags to categorize files.
FMS was a good project to spend my free time on while I was looking for a job, However, It is not my main focus at the moment.
